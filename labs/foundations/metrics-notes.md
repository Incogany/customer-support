# 📊 Support Metrics (Foundations)

## CSAT — Customer Satisfaction
- Measures how satisfied a customer is after a support interaction.
- Usually collected via a short survey (1–5 stars or %).
- Strongly influenced by empathy, clarity, and resolution quality.

## FRT — First Response Time
- Time between ticket creation and the first human response.
- Customers value acknowledgment, even if the fix takes longer.
- A fast FRT sets expectations and reduces frustration.

## FCR — First Contact Resolution
- Issue resolved without requiring follow-up.
- Reduces customer effort and repeat tickets.
- Achieved by asking the *right* questions early.

## NPS — Net Promoter Score
- Measures loyalty: “How likely are you to recommend us?”
- Reflects long-term customer trust, not just one ticket.

## Practical Insight
Good support improves **CSAT and FCR first**.  
Fast acknowledgment improves **FRT**, but quality resolution matters more.
